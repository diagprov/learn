# Learning Repository

This repository is full of [Short, Self Contained, Correct/Compilable, 
Examples](http://sscce.org) for all kinds of things in all kinds of programming 
languages. It is impossible to really categorize what is in here, except to say 
this generally focuses on smaller exercises of various features of programming 
languages, linking, assembly output etc.

Nothing beats trying it :)
